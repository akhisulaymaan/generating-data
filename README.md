# generating-data
This project is inspired by the book 'Pyhton Crash course' by Eric Mathes.
It is basically on how to do some data visualizations with Matplotlib and plotly.
we use Matplotlib to make 
simple plots, such as line graphs and scatter plots. Then we create a more 
interesting dataset based on the concept of a random walk—a visualization 
generated from a series of random decisions.
We also use Plotly, which creates visualizations that 
work well on digital devices, to analyze the results of rolling dice. 
Plotly generates visualizations that automatically resize to fit a variety of display devices. 
These visualizations can also include a number of interactive features, such as 
emphasizing particular aspects of the dataset when users hover over different 
parts of the visualization. Learning to use Matplotlib and Plotly will help you 
get started visualizing the kinds of data you’re most interested in.
